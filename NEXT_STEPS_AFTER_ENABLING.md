# ✅ Next Steps After Enabling GitHub Actions

Great! You've successfully enabled GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages. Here's what to do next:

## 🎯 What You DON'T Need to Do

### Custom Domain Section
- **Leave it EMPTY** - You don't need to fill this in
- This is only if you want to use your own domain (like `yourname.com`)
- For now, your site will be at: `bulletub.github.io/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/`
- You can always add a custom domain later if you want

## ✅ What Happens Next

1. **The workflow will run automatically:**
   - GitHub Actions will detect that Pages is enabled
   - It will build and deploy your site
   - This usually takes 1-3 minutes

2. **Check the Actions tab:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/bulletub/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/actions
   - You should see a workflow running or completed
   - Look for a green checkmark ✅ when it's done

3. **Your site will be live:**
   - URL: `https://bulletub.github.io/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/`
   - It may take 2-5 minutes after the workflow completes

## 🔍 How to Check Status

### Option 1: Check Actions Tab
1. Go to: https://github.com/bulletub/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Look for:
   - ✅ Green checkmark = Success
   - ❌ Red X = Failed (check the error)
   - 🟡 Yellow circle = Still running

### Option 2: Check Pages Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/bulletub/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/settings/pages
2. You should see: "Your site is published at https://bulletub.github.io/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/"

## 🚀 If the Workflow Succeeds

Your portfolio will be live at:
- **Main Portfolio**: https://bulletub.github.io/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/
- **Sandwich Spread**: https://bulletub.github.io/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/projects/sandwich-spread/
- **Weather Analyzer**: https://bulletub.github.io/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/projects/weather-analyzer/
- **DriftLens Blog**: https://bulletub.github.io/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/projects/driftlens-blog/
- **Pet Pantry**: https://bulletub.github.io/portfolio-final-projects-python-html-css-sql-etc-/projects/pet-pantry/

## 📝 About Custom Domain (Optional)

You can **skip this entirely** for now. Custom domains are only needed if:
- You want to use your own domain (e.g., `yourname.com`)
- You want a shorter URL
- You have a domain you've purchased

**To use a custom domain later:**
1. Purchase a domain from a registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Configure DNS records to point to GitHub Pages
3. Add the domain in the Custom Domain section
4. GitHub will provide instructions for DNS setup

**For now:** Just use the default GitHub Pages URL - it works perfectly!

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Workflow runs**: 1-3 minutes
- **Site becomes live**: 2-5 minutes after workflow completes
- **Total wait time**: Usually 3-8 minutes from enabling

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Just wait a few minutes and check:
1. Actions tab to see if workflow completed
2. Visit your site URL to see if it's live

No further action needed right now!
