                <p class="intro-text">I am passionate about <span class="highlight">cybersecurity</span>, <span class="highlight">error fixing</span>, <span class="highlight">debugging</span>, and <span class="highlight">hardware</span>. These interests drive my approach to software development, where I focus on creating secure, robust, and well-tested applications.</p>

                    <h3>My Development Experience</h3>
                    <p>Beyond the projects showcased in this portfolio, I have worked on numerous other projects that have shaped my development approach. My experience involves <span class="highlight">analyzing complex errors</span> systematically, breaking down problems into manageable components, and methodically tracing issues through codebases. I specialize in <span class="highlight">creating comprehensive layouts</span> for projects, planning the architecture and user interface flow before diving into implementation.</p>
                    
                    <p>My process involves <span class="highlight">plotting projects step by step</span>, mapping out features, dependencies, and potential challenges. I enjoy the challenge of <span class="highlight">figuring out how to code solutions</span> from scratch, researching best practices, experimenting with different approaches, and iterating until I find the most efficient and maintainable solution. This methodical approach has helped me tackle projects ranging from simple web applications to complex full-stack systems.</p>

            <div class="bio-text">
                <p>For all the projects showcased here, I collaborated with groupmates and utilized AI assistance for fixing errors, debugging, and cleaning up code. Each project represents a collaborative learning experience where we worked together to bring ideas to life.</p>
                
                <p><span class="highlight">Weather Analyzer & DriftLens Blog:</span> These two Python Flask projects were developed independently by me, demonstrating my ability to work solo on full-stack applications.</p>
                
                <p><span class="highlight">Sandwich Spread:</span> I modified and enhanced this Angular/Ionic mobile application, adapting it to meet specific requirements and improving its functionality.</p>
                
                <p><span class="highlight">Pet Pantry:</span> As the main contributor and project lead for this PHP e-commerce platform, I took responsibility for architecture decisions, feature implementation, and coordinating the development process.</p>
